//! `SqlCatalog` trait + descriptor-resolution error type.
//!
//! The SQL planner resolves collection metadata through the
//! `SqlCatalog` trait. Both Origin (via the host-side
//! `CredentialStore` + `SystemCatalog`) and Lite (via the embedded
//! redb catalog) implement it. The trait lives in its own file so
//! `types.rs` stays under the 500-line limit and so the error
//! surface has headroom for additional variants.

/// Errors surfaced by `SqlCatalog` implementations.
///
/// Only one variant today — callers pattern-match directly and
/// map the retryable case to `SqlError::RetryableSchemaChanged`
/// via the `From` impl in `error.rs`. The enum shape is kept
/// despite having a single variant so future variants can be
/// added without a breaking change.

///   An Origin implementation will have acquired a descriptor
///   lease at the current version before returning; subsequent
///   planning against the same collection within the lease
///   window is drain-safe.
/// - `Ok(None)` — the collection does not exist. Callers should
///   surface this as `SqlError::UnknownTable`.
/// - `Err(SqlCatalogError::RetryableSchemaChanged { .. })` —
///   the collection exists but a DDL drain is in progress.
///   Callers propagate this up so the pgwire layer can retry
///   the whole statement.
